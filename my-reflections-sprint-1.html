      <h1>TASK 1</h1>
      <h1 class="sub">Command Line</h1>
      <h2>In your reflection file, answer the following questions:</h2>
      <h3>How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of
        sentences?
        <details>
          A word driven finder that is faster when you can get the hang of it.
          Reduces the amount of visual sifting required when using finder and
          side clicking tasks.
        </details>
        <br>Can you think of an analogy for it?
          <details>
            Managing the computers tasks in a birds eye view, instead of being the
            minion carrying out each find and commit job, or perhaps having the
            camera in manual mode instead of auto (even thoughy most people find
            in more intuitive).
          </details>
          <br>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you
          make next time?
          <details>
            I think I did though not particularly intentionally, as pressure to
            learn 'on time' doesnt help me learn at all, so I see how long is
            expected then go with the flow around that general suggestion.
          </details>
          <br>Name five commands you used and what they do.
          <details>
            cd, change directory(jump into a folder) <br />
            cd .. go back out (or up) as they say, from where you are or what
            folder you are in. <br />
            ls: List the contents of the directory you are currently in. <br />
            mv: move or rename the directory of your specification. <br />
            pwd: Lets you know where you are located in the Terminal. <br />
          </details>
          <br>Did you learn anything unexpected?
          <details>
            That there isnt as much weirdness and commands to learn here as I
            thought, and that sudo is very useful to prove to my machine that I am
            the boss. Also so amny many many failures to troubleshoot when
            installing things and therefore commands not working oml how does
            anyone do this alone.

      <h1>TASK 2</h1>
      <h1 class="sub">Git/Github</h1>
      <h2>In your reflection file, answer the following questions:</h2>
      <h3>What's the difference between Git and GitHub? <details>Github in a server that sores repositories worked
          on
          by
          many different people possibly. Git is where you can clone resiories and work on them locally before
          pushing
          or
          pullings/merging others changes from the online github server. This also means it is harder to lose
          repository
          files when everyone has a clone on their local Git</details><br>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
        <details> Hmm, liiiike taking photocopies of a drawings,
          then
          drawing on the drawing, and if you like the additions you can propose to make it the orgin drawing for
          others to
          photocopy.</details><br>
        Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now
        if you didn't revisit the material? <details>I have been using Git/Github for a while now, so yes...
        </details>
        <br>
        Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not? <details> I was a bit faster because I am
          already
          familiar, yes still did some research especially on the command line uses for Github as I am more familiar
          with the desktop application.</details>

    <section class="block" style="margin:auto;">
      <h1>TASK 3</h1>
      <h1 class="sub">Explore Git</h1><br>
      <h2>In your reflection file, answer the following questions:</h2>
      <h3>
        What is a Git workflow? <details>A recipe for how to best utilize Git effectively based on team's needs
          and
          goal.</details>
        <br>
        What did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked? <details>The
          specific terms can stump me before I become familiar with their definition in a more famailiar and
          intuitive
          sense. I find the desktop app much more intuitive that the command like, but that is natural as it is
          visual. There is a certain force I have to use to make myself use words in Ubuntu to control my workflow,
          yet it will be worth it after that muscle memory is built.</details>
        <br>
        Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration?<details>Probably
          just
          play around with it with others to get a hands on sense ot it instead of simply theory and a little alone
          experimentation without the actual project objective being real.</details>

      <h1>TASK 4</h1>
      <h1 class="sub">Track & Commit</h1><br>
      <h2>In your reflection file, answer:</h2>
      <h3>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?<details>ing is getting your
          personal
          changes to a project ready
          to commit to the main project one or more people may be working on</details>

    <section class="block" style="margin:auto;">
      <h1>TASK 5</h1>
      <h1 class="sub">Branch Merg Pull</h1><br>
      <h3>
        What is main? <details>Main is the main repository where the well tested working code resides</details>
        <br>
        Why create a branch? <details>Branches are handy for devaloping experimentral or testing code
          adjustments
          that are not ready to be merged with main, or to have your code reviews by others before committing to
          main.</details>
        <br>
        Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand? <details>The concepts around
          branches and main all feel intuitive, the command line way of controlling it and memorising each command
          feels extremely difficult to adapt to intuitively.</details>

    <h1>Thinking Like a Programmer</h1>
    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <h3>
      What patterns do you see?<details>in the research I can see that people agree that problem solving is an
        under
        utilized practise in beginner coders instead of perfecting syntax. I see that understanding and planning
        are
        half the batter, then breaking down the task and trying one then another method of solving it, with the
        use of
        recourses at hand, google, other people, etc.</details>
      <br>
      What does my research say about <em>'Flipped Learning'</em> and how does it relate to our study?<details>
        FLipped
        learning is switching from lecture based class time approach to a group discussion/interactive/problem
        solving/activity based class time with presentations and lectures being homework does prior to this class
        period. This relates to us for a few reasons, as half our learning is based of problem solving alonside
        others, and what better time to practise that than when we are all together rather than simply absorbing
        presented material during this time instead of prior. Whilst this learning and teaching method sounds more
        satisfying and ideal more many, it is ofcourse another step toward better learning from a problematic one,
        and
        therefore should not be looked at as a solution, but merely a step in the problem solving that is how to
        teach
        and learn well. We are always making progress and should acknowledge that one style rarely suites all and
        look
        at each person as a whole being with their own valid needs and having the 'problem solving skills' and
        flexibility to adjust for differing needs is always going to be more helpful the one 'golden style' of
        teaching and learning./details>

    <h1 style="background-color: darkslategrey; opacity: 80%; padding: 20px">My Own Take</h1>
    <h2 class="sub" style="background-color: rgb(37, 79, 82); border-radius:0px 0px 50px 50px; padding: 20px;">For
      better or for worse, I seem to be (from suggesting evidence) inquisitive, open-minded, highly
      emotional, dedicated to kindness and empathy... bigger picture focused, and emotional in all directions. <br>I
      seem somewhat
      Impulsive and creative-minded.<br><br>
      Perhaps I remain less consistent in keeping my emotional state steady, maintaining reliability in consistency,
      completing of tasks, and carefully laid out plans, often because of the very same strengths already described.
      <br>There is simply too much big picture see, too much emotion, and far far too much empathy to really fit
      all things in a neat row of ducks <em>all</em> the time.<br>I am not sure how anyone does it...<br><br>Sometimes
      I remain unsure how
      constant
      rigidity (if reliable) is to be considered a strength at all, <br>(after we remove robot productivity and profit
      motive from the equation, which is really all made up anyway).<br><br> Such a <em>stubbornness</em> so many must
      bare, to maintain it.<br><em>Steady emotionality, steady task routine, head down, complete before starting anew,
        think before taking a
        step, risk not a slip or a scratch.</em><br><br>
      It makes me feel lonely to think this trait is a goal we keep for every growing human being, rather than being
      alarmed by the lack of peripheral we encourage in making our house walls so very small. With any luck, we will
      outgrow this house in no time.<br><br>
      And whilst we are growing out of these <em>old slow boots</em>, the vast, terrifying, populated, crazy, sometimes
      beautiful,
      and sometimes not so much <em>world</em>,<br>
      will never once stop happening.

      <h1>Final Questions!</h1><br>
      <h3>
        What parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face?<details>Practising whilst making
          something (this HTML) gives me so much more muscle memory than just trying to listen or digest or
          remember. Also I am good and soaking up the core values via the readings, but perhaps I am used to that
          from Uni. Putting in into my own words helps, especially in a project I know someone will look at and that
          I can customise.</details>
        <br><br>
        How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?<details>Very confident with the core, though
          my anxiety and executive function creates large barriers to reaching out and feeling safe and making
          simple tasks seem doable, but I understand the values and can write out my thoughts well. The Tech stuff,
          I am pretty confident with GitHub and Git Client, so the theory is there, but the command line still is
          struggling to feel natural to use. I am sure with practise and muscle memory and talking it through with
          friends I will get better fast though.</details><br><br>
        Which parts of the work did you enjoy?<details>If it isn't obvious, customnizing my work, even on top of
          homework, makes a project so much more satisfying to me, like I am 'making' something rather than simple
          ticking task boxes. I also enjoy the research side of it, especially around values and human behaviours,
          though find it comes more naturally to me and
          feel I need to focus on different skill sets such as syntax, problem solving, and techniocal mechanics.
        </details><br><br>
        Which parts of the work did you find tedious?<details>Listening to videos/trying to understand command
          lines as it feels like memorisation more than anything, and memorisation learning is less than stimulating
        </details>Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this sprint?
        <details><br><br>
          Yes, I struggle to memorise and stay focused on learning to memorise command lines. I also lose
          patience and stamina fast and whilst I learn fast, I usually dont do as many hours as the otrhers before I
          burn out.</details> <br><br>
        What did it say to you & do you believe what it said?<details>I have a lot of comp sci friends who like to
          flaunt their big egos and 'bestness' at all of it all the time, and whilst arguably this is not the most
          socially skilled path they are taking, and people are often hired for fit and then trained, it still
          drains the spirit when you cant keep up with the conversation/have to always justify your pace/and arnt
          making more than 30$ and hour for the same stuff. Also considering I am a bit older than them, cant really
          talk culture/world view/fine arts with them which is my main skill set at the moment, and don't make much
          money, and with my disabilities and stamina issues, may never make much money nomatter how clever I am,
          aswell as being a woman, WELL, as you can imagine it does, despite all sense of core values and aspiration
          for the world to be a kinder place, all feel awfully pointless many hours of many days, yes.</details>
