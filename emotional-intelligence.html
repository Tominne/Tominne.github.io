<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
<p>EQ is a cocktail of being able to observe and master mindfully ones own emotions, aswell as others. It envolves the ability to listen, process and build helful habits that help us navigate this unpredictable emotional world of people and ourselves.</p>>
<br>
<h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
<p>IQ is our problem solving ability in a data, number, predictable pattern kinda of way, which has little to do with interperonality, leadership, our own regulation, and caring for others.</p>
<p>EQ Is all about the inner and outer mind, whilst less predictable still helpful when observed, and practised charting these emotional and confusing inner and outer waters.</p>
<br>
<h2>Why is EQ important?
</h2>
<p>EQ is vastly important because it is key to community, teamwork which is often necessary in large projects, helping one stand out and get up the ladder, be happier in ones life as we grow that confidence and ability, and mostly enjoy where we are at and help connections grow across differences and in a perhapos more meaningful manner.</p></section>
