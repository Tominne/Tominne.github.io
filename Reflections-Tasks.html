    <h1 class="sub">Command Line</h1>
    <h2>In your reflection file, answer the following questions:</h2>
    <h3>
      <ol class="c">
        <li>How would you describe the command line in plain English in a couple of
          sentences?
          <details>
            A word driven finder that is faster when you can get the hang of it.
            Reduces the amount of visual sifting required when using finder and
            side clicking tasks.
          </details>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Can you think of an analogy for it?
        </li>
        <details>
          Managing the computers tasks in a birds eye view, instead of being the
          minion carrying out each find and commit job, or perhaps having the
          camera in manual mode instead of auto (even thoughy most people find
          in more intuitive).
          <li>
        </details>
        <br>
        <li>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you
          make next time?
          <details>
            I think I did though not particularly intentionally, as pressure to
            learn 'on time' doesnt help me learn at all, so I see how long is
            expected then go with the flow around that general suggestion.
          </details>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Name five commands you used and what they do.
          <details>
            cd, change directory(jump into a folder) <br />
            cd .. go back out (or up) as they say, from where you are or what
            folder you are in. <br />
            ls: List the contents of the directory you are currently in. <br />
            mv: move or rename the directory of your specification. <br />
            pwd: Lets you know where you are located in the Terminal. <br />
          </details>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Did you learn anything unexpected?
          <details>
            That there isnt as much weirdness and commands to learn here as I
            thought, and that sudo is very useful to prove to my machine that I am
            the boss. Also so amny many many failures to troubleshoot when
            installing things and therefore commands not working oml how does
            anyone do this alone.

    <h1 class="sub">Git/Github</h1>
    <h2>In your reflection file, answer the following questions:</h2>
    <h3>
      <ol class="c">
        <li>What's the difference between Git and GitHub? <details>Github in a server that sores repositories worked on
            by
            many different people possibly. Git is where you can clone resiories and work on them locally before pushing
            or
            pullings/merging others changes from the online github server. This also means it is harder to lose
            repository
            files when everyone has a clone on their local Git</details>
        </li><br>
        <li>Can you think of an analogy to describe them? <details> Hmm, liiiike taking photocopies of a drawings, then
            drawing on the drawing, and if you like the additions you can propose to make it the orgin drawing for
            others to
            photocopy.</details>
        </li><br>
        <li>
          Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now
          if you didn't revisit the material? <details>I have been using Git/Github for a while now, so yes...</details>
        </li><br>
        <li>Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not? <details> I was a bit faster because I am already
            familiar, yes still did some research especially on the command line uses for Github as I am more familiar
            with the desktop application.</details>
        </li>
      </ol>

    <section class="block" style="margin:auto;"><h1>TASK 3</h1>
    <h1 class="sub">Explore Git</h1><br>
    <h2>In your reflection file, answer the following questions:</h2>
    <h3>
      <ol class="c">
        <li>What is a Git workflow? <details>A recipe for how to best utilize Git effectively based on team's needs and
            goal.</details>
        </li><br>
        <li>What did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked? <details>The
            specific terms can stump me before I become familiar with their definition in a more famailiar and intuitive
            sense. I find the desktop app much more intuitive that the command like, but that is natural as it is
            visual. There is a certain force I have to use to make myself use words in Ubuntu to control my workflow,
            yet it will be worth it after that muscle memory is built.</details>
        </li><br>
        <li>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration?<details>Probably just
            play around with it with others to get a hands on sense ot it instead of simply theory and a little alone
            experimentation without the actual project objective being real.</details>

    <h1>TASK 4</h1>
    <h1 class="sub">Track & Commit</h1><br>
    <h2>In your reflection file, answer:</h2>
    <h3>
      <ol class="c">
        <li>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?<details>ing is getting your personal
            changes to a project ready
            to commit to the main project one or more people may be working on</details>
        </li>

      <h1>TASK 5</h1>
      <h1 class="sub">Branch Merg Pull</h1><br>
      <h3>
        <ol class="c">
          <li>What is main? <details>Main is the main repository where the well tested working code resides</details>
          </li>
          <li>Why create a branch? <details>Branches are handy for devaloping experimentral or testing code
              adjustments
              that are not ready to be merged with main, or to have your code reviews by others before committing to
              main.</details>
          </li>
          <li>Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand? <details>The concepts around
              branches and main all feel intuitive, the command line way of controlling it and memorising each command
              feels extremely difficult to adapt to intuitively.</details>
