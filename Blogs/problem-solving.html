      <h1 class="heading2">Time I was blocked by a simple problem:</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>
        1: Sometimes things that seem stupid trip you up like, opening a file
        not in Abuntu and then being unable to perform basic commands, or having
        console in the wrong repository and wondering why tests are not working,
        or missing a capital letter and not being able to debug code etc etc.<br /><br />
        2: It is tempting to hide when problems feel dumb or you feel like you
        are too far behind and it would be embarrassing. Some of the time I
        fiddling by myself for too long and worked it out, sometimes bing chat
        solved my dilemma for me (pointing out my > greater than symbol is
        facing the wrong way), and sometimes I asked for help and often was met
        with fairly lighthearted chill responses which improve my sense of
        connection as-well as helping me.<br /><br />
        3: I felt tired and lacking in motivation some of the time. Sometimes I
        can fiddle for ages and not get bored. I feel embarrassed getting stuck
        on basic things or stuff I should have done already, but usually feel
        okay after asking. I also feel scared to have to problem solve with a
        tutor as soon as I ask a question, I want to be able to ask stuff and
        try to remedy it later when i have energy. My asking and coding energy
        sometimes happens at differing times, even though I know that isn't the
        most easy way to fix all my code for either of us, but committing
        my-self to a potentially long back and forth every-time I have a
        question can on occasion stop me from asking immediately.<br /><br />
        4: I learn slowly that there is not as much to be scared of and everyone
        is human including the tutors especially here at Dev Ac.<br />
        I could be cheesy and say yay just ask, there is nothing to be scared
        of... but anxiety is not rational and there is a warm up period that
        often just needs to occur before trust is set, and the program should
        take that into account for some students if it is to be more inclusive
        and 'fair'.

        <h1 class="heading2">Time I solved a problem elegantly:</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>
        1: A problem was being unable to remove extra spaces between words after
        remove words I did not want from a sentence.<br /><br />
        2: A technique I used was labelling the problem clearly, trying a
        solution before asking for guidance, then following that guidance down a
        path of things I had not tried to come to a fix.<br /><br />
        3: Throughout the process I felt frustrated at first doing it alone,
        then amused by peers relating and joking about the issue ands trying to
        help, then on more of a roll as I found new things to try.<br /><br />
        4: I learnt that trying alone doing the same thing again and again is a
        waste of time and energy even though it can feel easiest to stay quiet
        and fiddle without reaching elsewhere be it peers or research (yay
        executive function).

    <h1 class="heading2">How confident I feel using each of these problem solving techniques:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode:</li><br><h2>I am confident in how to do it, though so far haven't used it an awful lot as I don't find much difference from haven written down goals and holding them in my brain. My mental multitasking is pretty decent.</h2>><br>
        <li>Trying something:</li><br><h2>Very confident, if anything this one is my default to a fault. I call it 'fiddling'</h2><br>
        <li>Rubber ducky method: </li><br><h2>Again the theory is well understood in my mind and it has definitely helped me with problems before outside of coding. I think it will be more handy later on but im not really good enough at js yet to have a clear enough dot to dot reasoning to describe let alone help me spot, yeah... but in the future I am sure!</h2>
        <li>Reading error messages: </li><br><h2>Takes a little forced habit making to get into, but I am getting better at checking them and understanding the reference they point out and what type of error they are showing me; though not always, sometimes its over my head still I am afraid, and sometimes I still get lost trying to find my console debugging output (speaking of basic dumb problems that are embarrassing to ask about)</h2>
        <li>Console.logging:</li><br><h2> I struggle to always find my console when I am not in a html browser, or even when I am in terminal it doesn't show output from consoles logs???? Idk man im failing this particular game mode.</h2>
        <li>Googling:</li><br> <h2> I am good at google research when I have the executive function. Sometimes it's hard for me to stop fiddling and actually go elsewhere on my pc to ask google or w/e, but I am decent at it when I do. Also when it presents me with a lot of theories and a lot of words, I get overwhelmed and have to resist clicking exit on the page immediately. Because of this, I find Bing chat much more specific and often more helpful as it gives me precise information without me having to sort through much and is often correct if not always it is a good start. I really do not know how people learnt coding before GPT chat, they had to actually ask PEOPLE everytime?! Lordy.</h2><br>
        <li>Asking your peers for help:</li><br><h2> I could be better but I do use it eventually. I do enjoy the interaction and leaning on each other but It takes me a while to warm up and feel safe.</li><br>
        <li>Asking coaches for help:</li><br><h2>Same as with the peers question with perhaps a bit more pressure to solve it immediately and fully participate in the interpersonal interaction of whatever form.</h2><br>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection:</li><br><h2> I enjoy the reflection side of things and often do it naturally, though I could do it more deliberately and clearly which I understand and accomplish sometimes, yet that damn executive function does like to yell "Halt!" at me every so often as per usual. This issue is worse if I am stressed or sad about anything as my learning feels less of a priority that my quest for wellbeing in my mind and makes it almost impossible to focus on for any extended time period. This is another thing I think you can't always just 'time manage' your way out of, and there is a point where the course needs to factor this in as something that will innevitably occur for some student if it wants to be inclusive and hold less ableism that we encounter everywhere.</h2><br>

        <h1 class="heading2">A time I was reluctant to ask for help:</h1><br>
        <h2>What made me reluctant?<br>
         Well, internalized expectation and embarrassment that obviously isn't helpful yet I think would be pretty silly to expect not to have been internalized deeply into many of us by the the narrow minded ableist society we live in.<br><br> This goes especially for a girl in a male dominant world LET ALONE in this male dominated topic of learning.<br>Expecting that anxiety to switch off because <em>'someone said so'</em> is entirely wishful thinking, but wouldn't that be great.<br>
        <br><br>I have encountered this a few times currently with getting confused about where to locate my console.log output, and I am working on the anxiety with a certain amount of 'exposure therapy' you might call it, by asking, and writing it here, yet there is a warm up time where a space must be supportive and safe that can not be skipped from the other end either.</h2>
