<h3>When wings sprout from my spine then you’ll see.. you’ll all see…</h1>
  <h1>
    At the beginning of each day:<br>
    Asking myself 'The Two Questions':<br>
    <em>What are my goals today?</em><br>
    <em>What are my challenges today?</em><br><br>
    And at the end of each day:
    <br>
    <em>Have I reached my goals for today?</em><br>
    And, <em>What have I learned today? </em>
  </h1>
  <p>
  <h1>Day 1</h1><br>
  <h2>Beginning of day questions:</h2> <br>
  <p> <b>Goals?</b></p>
  <details>Study for atleast four hours. Get an understanding of key concept for the first sprint.
  </details>
  <p><b>Challenges?</b></p>
  <details>Figure out a rhythm of
    the foundations course, AND what pace I am going to be getting into this first week.</details>
  <br>

  <div>
    <h2> End of day questions:</h2> <br>
    <b>What I have learned today?
    </b>
    </p>
    <details>Figuring out a rhythm that works for me is going to be one of the biggest learning curves, aswell as trying
      to
      communicate my specific needs to tutors without sounding like a special snowflake, or like I shouldn't be here
      because I am "too fragile". I have always been more sensitive and that isnt changing this year or the next so now
      is
      as good a time as any for me to be here and I can be quite stubborn about letting my singular sensitivities stop
      me
      as I think it allows many industries to rule out huge chuncks of the population instead of finding ways to work
      with
      them. <br> I studied for too long at once thismorning and burnt myself really hard with headaches and mind
      breaking
      fatigue for ther rest of the day. A bit of a narly beginning to the paper, but I suppose beginnings always are the
      hardest.</details>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p><b>Have I reached my goals for today?</b></p>
    <details>Got over the first and hardest challenge, diving in and starting. I managed to set up linux/abuntu in my
      terminal
      and vscode after a lot of headaches, got an idea of the framework and what topics to get into and how to reflect
      on each day as I go.</details>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h1>Day 2</h1><br>
  <h1>Beginning of day questions:</h1> <br>
  <p> <b>Goals?</b></p>
  <details>Set up my github and repository cloning. Get in the habit of reflecting and intentional learning as I go.
    Take more
    breaks more often. Troubleshoot ways to mainting my focus for longer without burning myself out (change of scenery,
    coffee, breaks, interaction, etc). Make progress into the first sprint and outline a plan of what to learn by the
    end of week one and when the group meeting is/who are my homegroup members.
  </details>
  <p><b>Challenges?</b></p>
  <details>Interacting with homegroup members and figuring out meeting schedules at the same time as learning sprints.
    (hard to focus on two different elements in one day, single minded task brain). Reminding myself to take breaks
    regularly and then getting back into the flow without burning out.</details>
