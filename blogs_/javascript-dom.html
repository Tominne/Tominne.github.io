                <br>
                <h2>The movement behind the river. The current and adaptability that bring something still and pretty to
                  life
                  and
                  weildly.<br>
                  CSS styles the river in all its colors and glory.<br>
                  HTML provides the layout, the substance, the water and the fish in as much detail as wanted.<br>
                  JavaScript is the code that pushed the substance to flow downstream if we ask it to, or to adapt to a
                  use
                  walking through the water. With learnt vareables, objects, functions, loops etc, the still image has
                  the
                  potential to respond just how we want it to. </h2>

      <br>
      <h2>Control flow is like the order of steps one must take to bake, first the oven prep then the wet mixtures,
        then
        the dry ingredients.<br>
        Loops are a way to repeat a task until the conditions you require are met. Perhaps the batter needs to be
        stirred
        3 times until fully mixed we can achieve that by running the same task until a certain requirement (less than
        or
        equal to fully mixed) is met at which point the mixing stops. </h2>

      <h1 class="heading2">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it:</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>The DOM represents elements of a documents as a tree like structure, and by specifying which node in this
        tree
        we wish to change (getElementById or querySelector) you can manipulate the document from the DOM.</h2>

      <h1 class="heading2">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects:</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>Both structures are a collection of data yet an array is purely a list of strings or integers that are
        refferences by their positioning in the list order, whereas objects are the collection of data types
        (key-value
        pairs) made from strings, that may well contain arrays in themselves.</h2>

    <section class="block" style="margin: auto;">
      <h1 class="heading2">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful:</h1>
      <br>
      <h2>Functions are the cog in the JS machine thats performs a task you want to happen. They take data/input from
        other
        areas of you code and runs through it in the way in which it is programmed returning a value or changing a
        display
        in your document.<br>
        Another reason they are so helpful is that they can be called again from anywhere is your js code without
        having
        to redeclare the function and all of its variables.
        Functions can also help test code in segments by running through data and returning feedback in an isolated or
        non
        isolated manner whithin the DOM or console.</h2>
